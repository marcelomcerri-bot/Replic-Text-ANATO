The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis

I cannot find any error lines in the snippet you provided â€” the "Logs:" section is empty. Without the actual failing lines from the Netlify deploy log I cannot isolate the exact error, file, or stack trace that caused the build to fail.
Solution â€” what I need from you and immediate troubleshooting steps

Please paste the relevant part of the Netlify deploy log (the failed deploy). Include at least the last ~200 lines around the failure. You can get this from Netlify UI: Site â†’ Deploys â†’ click the failed deploy â†’ Deploy log â†’ copy the final 200â€“400 lines. That will let me isolate the exact error lines.
While you grab the log, try these quick checks locally and collect the output to paste if the deploy still fails:
Run the same build command locally (from package.json). For npm:
npm ci
npm run build
If you use yarn:
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn build
Capture and paste any error/stack trace you see locally.
Common causes and how to fix them (apply depending on the error you see)

Missing dependency "Cannot find module" / Module not found
Verify the package name is listed in package.json and that package.json and package-lock.json / yarn.lock were committed to the repo.
If the package is missing from package.json, add it and commit:
npm install --save PACKAGE_NAME
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add PACKAGE_NAME"
git push
If the build error references a local file that cannot be found, verify the file was committed (case sensitivity matters on Linux hosts).
If the bundler/error suggests adding the package/file to an external list (e.g., build.rollupOptions.external), first verify the package is in package.json or the file was committed to the repo. Then add it to your bundler config only if it truly should be treated as external (example for Vite/Rollup):
// vite.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['some-external-package']
    }
  }
}
Node version mismatch / OpenSSL / runtime errors

If the log mentions Node version incompatibility or errors like OpenSSL issues, make sure Netlify is using the Node version your project expects. See Netlify docs to change Node versions: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript
To pin Node in Netlify, add an .nvmrc or engines field in package.json or set the NETLIFY environment variable for Node version.
Build script failure (npm run build exits non-zero)

Open the build log lines around the failing script (paste them). Often the error above the npm ERR! line is the root cause.
Check build environment variables (API keys, feature flags) on Netlify that may be required for the build.
Rollup / Vite / Next / framework-specific errors

If the error mentions Rollup/Vite, paste the Rollup/Vite error and I will show the exact config change.
If it mentions Next.js, ensure you are using a supported Next version for Netlify or using the official adapter.
Other useful items to paste (when you share the log)

The exact failing log lines (last ~200 lines).
package.json (scripts and dependencies).
netlify.toml (if present).
The build command Netlify uses (visible in Site settings or deploy log).
Your Node version in Netlify settings or contents of .nvmrc / package.json engines.
Once you paste the failing log lines I will:

isolate the exact error lines,
identify the precise error type and root cause,
give the exact code/config edits or commands to fix it (including verifying package.json before recommending external config changes and linking Node docs if Node mismatch is involved).

Result
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error "Your publish directory cannot be the same as the base directory of your site."

The root cause was identified in the site configuration: the publish directory was incorrectly set to ****** (the base directory) through the Netlify UI settings, while the netlify.toml file had no explicit publish directory configured.

The fix involved adding publish = ".next" to the [build] section in netlify.toml. This explicitly sets the correct output directory for Next.js builds, ensuring the @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin can process the build artifacts properly.

With this change, the Next.js build output in the .next directory will be correctly identified as the publish directory, resolving the configuration conflict that prevented deployment.
